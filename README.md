# About

My name is **António Oliveira**, I'm 22 years old, based in Porto, and I'm currently a student of the Informatics and Computation Engineering Masters in FEUP. 

I'm a detail-oriented, extroverted graduate who loves programming and solving complex problems. I'm a passionate and avid developer, and my main areas of interest are *Back-end Development*, *Machine Learning* and *Artificial Intelligence*.

At present, I'm developing my master's dissertation on *Graph Reinforcement Learning for Improving Smart Grid Services* focused on researching and improving reinforcement learning algorithms applied to graph-based structures and using smart grid services, namely *Dynamic Economic Dispatch* systems, as the application domain.
